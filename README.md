ARC9 Universal Manipulation sideproject. Allows the user to contort ARC9 in ways that are far beyond what was ever intended.

HERE BE DRAGONS: This is a powertool. By using this, you run the risk of instability, broken behavior, and/or poor performance. Unlameifier does not cause any permanent or irreversible damage as it does not directly modify anything. It is completely safe to test and experiment with in its current state and will continue to be so even when it is released on workshop.

UPD: 1/28/2025: We are making necessary preparations for Workshop Release. Please bear in mind that presets using Unlameifier may break during this time.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED (But we are working as quickly as we can). THIS WILL ALL BE UPLOADED TO THE WORKSHOP WHEN IT HAS REACHED A POINT OF GENERAL COMPLETION. FURTHERMORE, THE CONTENTS OF UNLAMEIFIER WILL BE SEPARATED INTO PARTS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF IT.

PLEASE DO NOT REUPLOAD UNLAMEIFIER TO THE WORKSHOP.

Thank you :)

If you are experiencing problems with Unlameifier such as tools not working the way they're stated to work (Please note: Unlameifier is being tested using Darsu's Escape from Tarkov Weapons at this time of writing) please report them to @neosunpersonal at the Diamond Doves' Discord Server's tech support channel (linked here: https://discord.gg/gaHXusZ ). This is so I can better track your issue and get help from other code-savvy members from the group should I need it (or I am just simply not available). Messages sent to my DMs directly will be promptly ignored for this reason. Thank you for your understanding.
