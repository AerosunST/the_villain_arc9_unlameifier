ATT.Description = [[Welcome to Unlameifier! To get started, you'll want to equip this attachment where you feel it will be appropriate for what you will be using it for (i.e. attachments should go on an attachment rail, muzzles go on a muzzle, etc). This is a universal attachment that will appear in every slot, regardless of what ARC9 weapon you use it on.

Please bear in mind that while Unlameifier strives to support as many weapon packs as possible, there is a possibility that certain weapons will not behave as intended because of how they are internally coded. If you come across such cases, be sure to leave an issue report at <color=255,255,0>https://github.com/AerosunST/the_villain_arc9_unlameifier/issues</color> or on the Weapon Pack Issues thread on the Workshop page so it can easily be tracked! Also make sure to check the Patches folder AND visit the Known Issues thread on the Workshop page before filing an issue with a weapon pack. Thank you for your understanding, and have fun!

If you are a developer wanting to add content to Unlameifier or want to add support for your own weapons, please check out our documentation at (m541_pls_add_link). Weapons are as easy as just making an empty slot!]]
