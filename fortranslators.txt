[Basics]
1. Create an account on Github if you do not have one already.
2. Download "Github Desktop" ( https://github.com/apps/desktop ).
3. Once downloaded, installed and opened, click on "File" then "Clone repository..."
4. Click on "URL" and input either the URL ( https://github.com/AerosunST/the_villain_arc9_unlameifier ) or the username and repository ( "AerosunST/the_villain_arc9_unlameifier" ). Then select where to download the files (folder will be created within the local path, so ensure it is, for example, "Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons") and click "Clone".

[Editing]
1. Once cloned, click on "Current branch" (located in the middle as a large button) and click "New branch". Name it whatever you want.
2. Open what you wish to open using any editing software. Notepad++ is recommended for this ( https://notepad-plus-plus.org ).
	∟ Localizations are located in "lua/arc9/common/localization" and have a suffix depending on the language.
	∟ Attachments are located in "lua/arc9/common/attachments_bulk".
3. Once you have done your additions or edits, do a pull request. You do this by opening Github Desktop, and inputting a title and description in the bottom left, then clicking "Commit".
4. Wait for your request to be accepted, then your changes will be made available in the main branch of the addon!
