Includes localizations for every accessory and outright weird attachment part of Unlameifier.
If a localization uses "ARC9:GetPhrase(TEXT)" in any line, it means it uses a string previously made in the file.
If this is a localization file for anything but English (i.e. Spanish), then those can be safely removed or commented out.
Note that there is a chance that not all localizations are up-to-date, and there might be missing some, or some might exist for removed accessories.

If you wish to translate to another language, you can copy+paste this file and replace "_en" with the codename for your own language.
For example, Spanish is "_es-es" and Russian is "_ru".

If a localization has multiple lines, you have two choices:
One: Use quotations at the start and end, for example "Text" with '\n' in place of line skips, for example "Text\nText2".
Note: If you wish to use quotation marks, you'll need to write it as < \" >

Two: Use square brackets at the start and end. Example further down.

[[ Text in Line 1
Text in Line 2 ]]
